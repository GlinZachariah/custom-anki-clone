Example: SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id; Returns only users who have placed orders.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 28,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a LEFT JOIN?',\n    answer: 'LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match exists, NULL values are returned for right table columns. Useful for finding records that may or may not have related data.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 29,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a RIGHT JOIN?',\n    answer: 'RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match exists, NULL values are returned for left table columns. It\\'s the opposite of LEFT JOIN but less commonly used.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 30,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?',\n    answer: 'FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values where no match exists. It combines the results of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs, showing all records from both tables regardless of matches.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 31,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a CROSS JOIN?',\n    answer: 'CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables - every row from the first table combined with every row from the second table. If table A has 10 rows and table B has 5 rows, CROSS JOIN returns 50 rows.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 32,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a subquery?',\n    answer: 'A subquery (or inner query) is a SQL query nested inside another query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. The inner query executes first, and its result is used by the outer query.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 33,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is GROUP BY used for?',\n    answer: 'GROUP BY groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It\\'s typically used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group. Example: SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY city;'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 34,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is the HAVING clause?',\n    answer: 'HAVING filters groups created by GROUP BY, similar to how WHERE filters individual rows. HAVING is used with aggregate functions. Example: SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 35,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?',\n    answer: 'WHERE filters individual rows before grouping, while HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY is applied. WHERE cannot use aggregate functions, but HAVING can. WHERE is processed before GROUP BY, HAVING is processed after.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 36,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a UNION in SQL?',\n    answer: 'UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicate rows. All SELECT statements must have the same number of columns with compatible data types. UNION ALL includes duplicates.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 37,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?',\n    answer: 'UNION removes duplicate rows from the combined result set, while UNION ALL includes all rows including duplicates. UNION ALL is faster because it doesn\\'t perform duplicate checking, but UNION ensures unique results.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 38,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is an index in SQL?',\n    answer: 'An index is a database object that improves query performance by creating a sorted reference to table data. Like a book index, it allows the database to quickly locate specific rows without scanning the entire table.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 39,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are the types of indexes?',\n    answer: 'Main index types include: Clustered (physically orders data), Non-clustered (separate structure pointing to data), Unique (enforces uniqueness), Composite (multiple columns), and Partial (subset of rows based on conditions).'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 40,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a foreign key?',\n    answer: 'A foreign key is a column (or combination of columns) that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between tables and enforces referential integrity, ensuring related data remains consistent.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 41,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is referential integrity?',\n    answer: 'Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. When a foreign key references a primary key, the referenced record must exist, and you cannot delete a referenced record while it has dependent records.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 42,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are SQL functions?',\n    answer: 'SQL functions perform specific operations and return values. Types include: String functions (LENGTH, SUBSTRING), Numeric functions (ABS, ROUND), Date functions (NOW, DATE_ADD), and Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG).'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 43,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are common string functions in SQL?',\n    answer: 'Common string functions include: CONCAT (join strings), LENGTH/LEN (string length), SUBSTRING (extract part of string), UPPER/LOWER (change case), TRIM (remove spaces), REPLACE (substitute text).'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 44,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are common date functions in SQL?',\n    answer: 'Common date functions include: NOW() (current date/time), CURDATE() (current date), DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB (add/subtract time), YEAR/MONTH/DAY (extract parts), DATEDIFF (difference between dates).'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 45,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a CASE statement?',\n    answer: 'CASE provides conditional logic in SQL queries, similar to if-else statements. It evaluates conditions and returns different values based on the results. Syntax: CASE WHEN condition THEN result ELSE default_result END.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 46,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is the EXISTS operator?',\n    answer: 'EXISTS tests whether a subquery returns any rows. It returns TRUE if the subquery finds matching rows, FALSE otherwise. Often used for checking relationships between tables without actually joining them.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 47,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is normalization in databases?',\n    answer: 'Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Each form builds on the previous one.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 49,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is a view in SQL?',\n    answer: 'A view is a virtual table based on a SQL query. It doesn\\'t store data physically but presents data from one or more tables. Views can simplify complex queries, provide security by limiting data access, and create reusable query logic.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 50,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are the advantages of using views?',\n    answer: 'Views provide: Security (limit access to specific columns/rows), Simplicity (hide complex joins), Reusability (common queries as named objects), Data independence (isolate applications from table structure changes), and Consistency (standardized data presentation).'\n  },\n\n  // EXPERT FLASHCARDS (25 cards)\n  {\n    id: 51,\n    category: 'expert',\n    question: 'What is query optimization?',\n    answer: 'Query optimization is the process of choosing the most efficient execution plan for a SQL query. The optimizer analyzes different ways to execute a query and selects the plan with the lowest estimated cost based on factors like I/O, CPU usage, and memory consumption.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 52,\n    category: 'expert',\n    question: 'What is an execution plan?',\n    answer: 'An execution plan shows how the database engine will execute a query, including the order of operations, join methods, index usage, and estimated costs.
