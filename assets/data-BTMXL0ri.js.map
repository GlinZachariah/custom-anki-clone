Topics are partitioned and distributed across multiple brokers for scalability. Each topic can have multiple partitions, and messages within a partition are ordered by offset.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Partition?',\n    answer: 'A Partition is a unit of parallelism in Kafka. Each topic is divided into one or more partitions, which are distributed across brokers. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally and enable parallel processing by multiple consumers. Messages within a partition are ordered.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 4,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Producer?',\n    answer: 'A Producer is a client application that publishes messages to Kafka topics. Producers determine which partition to send messages to (either randomly, by key hash, or using custom partitioning logic), and handle batching, compression, and delivery guarantees.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Consumer?',\n    answer: 'A Consumer is a client application that reads messages from Kafka topics. Consumers can read from one or more partitions and belong to consumer groups for load balancing. They track their position using offsets and can choose to commit offsets manually or automatically.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 6,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Broker?',\n    answer: 'A Broker is a Kafka server that stores and serves messages. Brokers form a cluster and handle client requests for producing and consuming messages. Each broker hosts multiple partitions and can act as a leader or follower for different partitions.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 7,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Offset?',\n    answer: 'An Offset is a unique identifier for each message within a partition. It represents the position of a message in the partition log and is used by consumers to track their reading progress. Offsets are sequential numbers starting from 0.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 8,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is ZooKeeper\\'s role in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'ZooKeeper (being phased out in favor of KRaft) manages Kafka cluster metadata, including broker information, topic configurations, partition leadership, and consumer group coordination. It provides distributed coordination services for cluster management and configuration storage.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 9,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is a Kafka Consumer Group?',\n    answer: 'A Consumer Group is a set of consumers that work together to consume a topic. Partitions are distributed among consumers in the group, ensuring each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group at a time. This enables load balancing and fault tolerance.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 10,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is partition replication in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Partition replication creates multiple copies of each partition across different brokers for fault tolerance.

A single consumer group provides queue semantics, multiple groups provide pub-sub semantics.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 12,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What determines message ordering in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Messages are ordered within a partition, not across partitions. If you need global ordering, use a single partition. For key-based ordering, messages with the same key go to the same partition, maintaining order for that key while allowing parallelism across different keys.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 13,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is message retention in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Retention determines how long messages are stored in Kafka. It can be time-based (e.g., 7 days) or size-based (e.g., 1GB per partition). Messages are not deleted immediately after consumption; they remain available for the retention period, allowing multiple consumers or reprocessing.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 14,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is the role of the Kafka partition key?',\n    answer: 'The partition key determines which partition a message is sent to. Messages with the same key always go to the same partition (unless partition count changes), ensuring ordering for related messages. If no key is provided, messages are distributed round-robin across partitions.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 15,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What are Kafka bootstrap servers?',\n    answer: 'Bootstrap servers are the initial list of Kafka brokers that clients use to connect to the cluster. Clients only need to specify a few brokers initially - they will discover the full cluster topology automatically. This provides resilience if some brokers are temporarily unavailable.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 16,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is producer acknowledgment (acks) in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Acknowledgment (acks) controls producer delivery guarantees: acks=0 (no acknowledgment, fastest but riskiest), acks=1 (leader acknowledgment only), acks=all/-1 (all in-sync replicas must acknowledge, slowest but safest). Higher acks values provide better durability.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 17,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is consumer lag in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Consumer lag is the difference between the latest message offset in a partition and the last committed offset by a consumer. High lag indicates the consumer is falling behind producers. Monitoring lag helps identify performance issues and scaling needs.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 18,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is the purpose of Kafka Connect?',\n    answer: 'Kafka Connect is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems (databases, search engines, file systems).

They don\\'t affect partitioning but provide additional context like message type, source, timestamp, or routing information. Headers are useful for filtering, routing, or processing decisions.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 20,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is the Kafka log structure?',\n    answer: 'Kafka stores messages in append-only logs on disk. Each partition is a log file that grows by appending new messages. The log is segmented into files for efficient management, cleanup, and compaction. This design provides high throughput and durability.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 21,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is auto-commit in Kafka consumers?',\n    answer: 'Auto-commit automatically commits consumer offsets at regular intervals (default every 5 seconds). While convenient, it can lead to message loss or duplication if failures occur between commits. Manual commit provides more control over when offsets are committed.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 22,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous producers?',\n    answer: 'Synchronous producers wait for acknowledgment before sending the next message, providing immediate feedback but lower throughput. Asynchronous producers send messages without waiting, achieving higher throughput but requiring error handling through callbacks.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 23,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is partition leadership in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Each partition has one leader broker that handles all reads and writes for that partition. Follower brokers replicate the leader\\'s data. If the leader fails, one of the followers becomes the new leader through automatic failover, ensuring high availability.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 24,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is the Kafka client API structure?',\n    answer: 'Kafka provides four main client APIs: Producer API (publish messages), Consumer API (consume messages), Streams API (process streams), and Admin API (manage cluster). Each API is designed for specific use cases and provides different levels of abstraction.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 25,\n    category: 'basics',\n    question: 'What is message serialization in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Serialization converts objects to bytes for storage/transmission. Kafka requires serializers for keys and values (e.g., StringSerializer, IntegerSerializer, AvroSerializer). Proper serialization is crucial for data compatibility and evolution, especially in heterogeneous environments.'\n  },\n\n  // INTERMEDIATE FLASHCARDS (25 cards)\n  {\n    id: 26,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is Kafka Streams?',\n    answer: 'Kafka Streams is a Java library for building stream processing applications on top of Kafka.

KTable represents a changelog stream where records represent updates to a table (key-value store). KStream is append-only, while KTable maintains the latest value for each key.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 28,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is consumer group rebalancing?',\n    answer: 'Rebalancing redistributes partitions among consumers in a group when membership changes (consumer joins/leaves/fails). During rebalancing, all consumers pause consumption while partitions are reassigned. This ensures each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 29,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are Kafka Streams tasks?',\n    answer: 'Tasks are the units of parallelism in Kafka Streams. Each task processes one or more partitions and maintains its own state. The number of tasks equals the maximum number of partitions across all input topics. Tasks can be distributed across multiple application instances.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 30,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is log compaction in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'Log compaction retains only the latest value for each key within a partition, removing older versions. This creates a key-value snapshot while preserving the log structure. It\\'s useful for maintaining current state (like user profiles) while providing durability and replication.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 31,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is ISR (In-Sync Replicas) in Kafka?',\n    answer: 'ISR is the set of replica brokers that are fully caught up with the partition leader. Only ISR members can become leaders during failover. The ISR list dynamically changes as replicas fall behind or catch up, ensuring data consistency and availability trade-offs.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 32,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What are Kafka producer batching and compression?',\n    answer: 'Batching groups multiple messages before sending to improve throughput and reduce network overhead. Compression (gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd) reduces message size. Both optimizations increase latency slightly but significantly improve overall performance, especially for high-volume scenarios.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 33,\n    category: 'intermediate',\n    question: 'What is the purpose of Kafka Schema Registry?',\n    answer: 'Schema Registry manages and enforces schemas for Kafka messages, providing schema evolution, compatibility checking, and centralized schema storage.
