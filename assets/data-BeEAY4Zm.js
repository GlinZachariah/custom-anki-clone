Unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions (NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) - handling is optional. Error class represents serious system problems.",category:"intermediate"},{id:38,question:"What is the finally block used for?",answer:"The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's used for cleanup code like closing files, database connections, or other resources. Finally executes even if there's a return statement in try/catch blocks.",category:"intermediate"},{id:39,question:"What is the difference between throw and throws?",answer:"'throw' is used to explicitly throw an exception in code (throw new Exception()). 'throws' is used in method signature to declare that method might throw specific exceptions (public void method() throws IOException). One throws exceptions, other declares them.",category:"intermediate"},{id:40,question:"What are static methods and variables?",answer:"Static members belong to the class rather than instances. Static variables are shared among all instances. Static methods can be called without creating objects and can only access static members directly.

Threads share process memory but have separate stacks.",category:"expert"},{id:52,question:"What is the difference between Thread and Runnable?",answer:"Thread is a class that implements Runnable. Extending Thread limits inheritance (single inheritance), while implementing Runnable allows extending other classes. Runnable is preferred as it separates task from thread management and promotes composition over inheritance.",category:"expert"},{id:53,question:"What are synchronized methods and blocks?",answer:"Synchronization prevents race conditions in multithreading. Synchronized methods lock the entire object, synchronized blocks lock specific code sections. Only one thread can execute synchronized code on an object at a time. Uses intrinsic locks (monitors).",category:"expert"},{id:54,question:"What is reflection in Java?",answer:"Reflection allows examining and modifying program behavior at runtime.
