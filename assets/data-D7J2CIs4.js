It uses standard HTTP methods and follows principles like statelessness, uniform interface, and resource-based URLs to create scalable and maintainable APIs."},{id:2,category:"basics",question:"What are the main HTTP methods used in REST APIs?",answer:"The main HTTP methods are: GET (retrieve data), POST (create new resources), PUT (update/replace entire resources), PATCH (partial updates), DELETE (remove resources), HEAD (get headers only), and OPTIONS (check allowed methods)."},{id:3,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 200 mean?",answer:"HTTP 200 OK indicates that the request was successful. The server has processed the request successfully and is returning the requested data in the response body."},{id:4,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 404 mean?",answer:"HTTP 404 Not Found indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. The URL may be incorrect or the resource may have been deleted or moved."},{id:5,category:"basics",question:"What is the difference between PUT and POST?",answer:"POST is used to create new resources and is not idempotent (repeated calls create multiple resources). PUT is used to create or replace entire resources and is idempotent (repeated calls have the same effect)."},{id:6,category:"basics",question:"What are REST API design principles?",answer:"Key principles include: 1) Stateless - each request contains all necessary information, 2) Uniform interface - consistent resource naming and HTTP methods, 3) Client-server separation, 4) Cacheable responses, 5) Layered system architecture, 6) Code-on-demand (optional)."},{id:7,category:"basics",question:"What is a resource in REST API context?",answer:"A resource is any information that can be named and addressed through a URI. Resources are the fundamental concept in REST - they represent entities like users, products, or orders, and are manipulated using standard HTTP methods."},{id:8,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 201 mean?",answer:"HTTP 201 Created indicates that the request was successful and a new resource has been created. It's typically returned after successful POST requests that create new entities."},{id:9,category:"basics",question:"What is the purpose of HTTP headers?",answer:"HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. They include metadata like content type, authorization tokens, caching directives, user agent information, and custom application-specific data."},{id:10,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 400 mean?",answer:"HTTP 400 Bad Request indicates that the server cannot process the request due to client error, such as invalid syntax, malformed request, or invalid parameters."},{id:11,category:"basics",question:"What is JSON and why is it commonly used in APIs?",answer:"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format. It's commonly used in APIs because it's human-readable, language-independent, supports complex data structures, and is easy to parse and generate."},{id:12,category:"basics",question:"What is a URL path parameter?",answer:"Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path that identify specific resources. For example, in `/users/{id}`, `{id}` is a path parameter that specifies which user to retrieve, like `/users/123`."},{id:13,category:"basics",question:"What are query parameters in URLs?",answer:"Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to a URL after a `?` symbol, separated by `&`. They're used for filtering, sorting, pagination, or passing optional data.

It's a generic error message for server-side issues."},{id:15,category:"basics",question:"What is the Content-Type header?",answer:"Content-Type header specifies the media type of the request or response body. Common values include `application/json` for JSON data, `application/xml` for XML, and `text/html` for HTML content."},{id:16,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 401 mean?",answer:"HTTP 401 Unauthorized indicates that the request requires authentication. The client must provide valid credentials to access the resource."},{id:17,category:"basics",question:"What does HTTP status code 403 mean?",answer:"HTTP 403 Forbidden indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. The client may be authenticated but lacks permission to access the resource."},{id:18,category:"basics",question:"What is API endpoint?",answer:"An API endpoint is a specific URL where an API can be accessed by a client application. It represents a touchpoint of communication between the client and server, typically combining a base URL with a resource path."},{id:19,category:"basics",question:"What is the difference between PATCH and PUT?",answer:"PUT replaces the entire resource with the provided data, while PATCH applies partial modifications to a resource. PUT requires sending the complete resource representation, whereas PATCH only sends the fields to be changed."},{id:20,category:"basics",question:"What does stateless mean in REST APIs?",answer:"Stateless means that each API request must contain all the information necessary to process it. The server doesn't store any client context between requests, making the system more scalable and reliable."},{id:21,category:"basics",question:"What is a base URL in API context?",answer:"A base URL is the root URL for an API that precedes all endpoint paths. For example, if the base URL is `https://api.example.com/v1`, then the full endpoint URL would be `https://api.example.com/v1/users`."},{id:22,category:"basics",question:"What are HTTP response codes in the 2xx range?",answer:"2xx status codes indicate success.

They indicate issues with the client request."},{id:24,category:"basics",question:"What is idempotency in REST APIs?",answer:"Idempotency means that making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, while POST is not. This property is important for reliability and retry logic."},{id:25,category:"basics",question:"What is the Accept header?",answer:"The Accept header tells the server what media types the client can process. For example, `Accept: application/json` indicates the client prefers JSON responses. It helps with content negotiation."},{id:26,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API authentication?",answer:"API authentication is the process of verifying the identity of clients making API requests. Common methods include API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and basic authentication. It ensures only authorized users can access protected resources."},{id:27,category:"intermediate",question:"What is an API key and how is it used?",answer:"An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate API requests. It's typically passed in headers (Authorization or X-API-Key), query parameters, or request body. API keys are simple but should be kept secret and rotated regularly."},{id:28,category:"intermediate",question:"What is OAuth 2.0?",answer:"OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts. It provides secure delegated access without sharing passwords, using access tokens with defined scopes and expiration times."},{id:29,category:"intermediate",question:"What is a JWT (JSON Web Token)?",answer:"JWT is a compact, URL-safe token format for securely transmitting information between parties.

It uses HTTP headers to control which origins can access resources, preventing unauthorized cross-domain requests."},{id:38,category:"intermediate",question:"What are CORS preflight requests?",answer:"Preflight requests are OPTIONS requests sent by browsers before certain cross-origin requests to check if the actual request is allowed. They occur for non-simple requests (custom headers, certain content types, or non-GET/POST methods)."},{id:39,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API rate limiting?",answer:"Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make within a time window. It prevents abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects server resources. Common strategies include token bucket, leaky bucket, and fixed/sliding window approaches."},{id:40,category:"intermediate",question:"What headers are used for rate limiting information?",answer:"Common rate limiting headers include: X-RateLimit-Limit (total allowed requests), X-RateLimit-Remaining (remaining requests), X-RateLimit-Reset (reset time), and Retry-After (when to retry after hitting limits)."},{id:41,category:"intermediate",question:"What is content negotiation in APIs?",answer:"Content negotiation allows clients and servers to agree on the best representation of resources. It uses headers like Accept (preferred response format), Accept-Language (preferred language), and Accept-Encoding (compression) to select appropriate content."},{id:42,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API caching?",answer:"API caching stores frequently requested data to improve performance and reduce server load. It can occur at multiple levels: browser cache, CDN, reverse proxy, or application cache. Proper cache headers control caching behavior."},{id:43,category:"intermediate",question:"What are important HTTP caching headers?",answer:"Key caching headers include: Cache-Control (caching directives), ETag (resource version identifier), Last-Modified (last modification date), Expires (absolute expiration time), and If-None-Match/If-Modified-Since (conditional requests)."},{id:44,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API testing?",answer:"API testing verifies that APIs meet expectations for functionality, performance, reliability, and security. It includes unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, load tests, and security tests to ensure API quality throughout development."},{id:45,category:"intermediate",question:"What is the difference between API testing and unit testing?",answer:"Unit testing tests individual components in isolation, while API testing tests the entire API interface including request/response handling, data validation, business logic, and integration between components. API testing is more comprehensive and end-to-end."},{id:46,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API monitoring?",answer:"API monitoring continuously tracks API performance, availability, and usage metrics. It includes uptime monitoring, response time tracking, error rate analysis, and usage analytics to ensure APIs meet service level agreements and user expectations."},{id:47,category:"intermediate",question:"What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs?",answer:"Synchronous APIs wait for the operation to complete before returning a response. Asynchronous APIs return immediately with a status and provide the result later through callbacks, polling, or webhooks. Async is better for long-running operations."},{id:48,category:"intermediate",question:"What are webhooks?",answer:"Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify external systems when specific events occur. Instead of polling for updates, the server sends POST requests to registered URLs when events happen, enabling real-time notifications and integrations."},{id:49,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API filtering?",answer:"API filtering allows clients to retrieve specific subsets of data by applying criteria. Common approaches include query parameters (?status=active), OData-style filters, or custom filtering syntax to reduce data transfer and improve performance."},{id:50,category:"intermediate",question:"What is API sorting?",answer:"API sorting allows clients to order results by specified fields. Common implementations use query parameters like ?sort=name,+date (ascending) or ?sort=-created_at (descending).
